However, additional amplification of the responsibilities implied by such primacy can exist in an agreement that further defines search and rescue responsibilities between the US and that nation. This is true even in situations that involve US persons.

24,DOD In A Supported Role,"<p>In a supported role, the Chief of Mission supports the geographic combatant commander when the geographic combatant commander seeks assistance from the Chief of Mission.

Two of the three military members were able to egress the area away from the protestors with the help of South Korean riot police.  The remaining military member was kidnapped by the protesters and taken to a larger demonstration area. The kidnapped military member was beaten and forced to make a videotaped anti-American statement and to apologize for his action that led to being kidnapped. Eventually he was taken to a hospital where further videotaped statements we recorded. South Korea police were in the hospital and the kidnapped military member was turned over to them. He was later charged with assault by South Korean police which he said was self-defense. US Military leaders in South Korea worked with US Embassy officials to successfully have the charges dropped.</p>
25,DOD Personnel Responsibilities In A US Diplomatic Environment,<p>A country clearance is required for DOD personnel to enter a foreign country to conduct official DOD business and activities.
